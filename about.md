My name is Alex. I'm a web developer living and working in Toronto. I teach children to code, I'm part of a budding start up and I love music.  

I'm always looking to learn new things. As I do I'll try to document what I deem useful in the hopes that someone else may also benefit.  

Thanks for visiting and stay in touch.
